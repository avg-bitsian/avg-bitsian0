Hey, there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.
I am a sophomore student at BITS Pilani.  
  
I enjoy watching Formula 1, air crash investigations, Gordon Ramsay's cooking shows, and listening to American 80s Rock music. I am an extrovert by nature.  In my free time, I spend an ungodly amount of time browsing Quora and reddit. Sometimes, I make puns.

Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
